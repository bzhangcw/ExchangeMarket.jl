# Arrow–Debreu wealth redistribution — master (primal), dual, n-call
# pricing oracle, test-error, and the zero-atom drop primitive. The
# column-generation loop (`run_ad_tracked`) lives in cpm_ad.jl.
#
# This is the Arrow–Debreu sibling of the Fisher master/dual file
# (redistribute.jl; the loop sibling is cpm.jl). It mirrors `§ The Arrow–Debreu case` in
# overleaf/read-econ/wealth-dist.tex. The difference from Fisher is the
# atom variable and the supply constraint:
#
#   Fisher : scalar budget w_t ≥ 0, Σ_t w_t = 1 (scalar dual μ),
#            predictor Σ_t w_t γ_t(p_k).
#   AD     : endowment b_t ∈ ℝⁿ₊,   Σ_t b_t = δ·1 (n-vector dual ν),
#            price-dependent budget w_{t,k} = ⟨p_k, b_t⟩,
#            predictor Σ_t ⟨p_k, b_t⟩ γ_t(p_k).
#
# The supply scale δ (sec.wealth.ad.scale / eq.ad.master.scaled) defaults to
# the unit supply δ = 1; it can be fixed at another value (--ad-delta) or left
# to the master as an LP variable (--ad-delta-free). The balance residual then
# carries the known shift (δ-1)p_k; cuts and pricing are unchanged.
#
# Homothetic classes only (ces / linear / leontief): there is no pinning
# machinery here, so the loop is simpler than run_method_tracked.
#
# Key reuse: the AD reduced cost for good j is exactly the Fisher reduced
# cost evaluated on the price-reweighted dual ũ^{(j)}_k = (p_k)_j · u_k
# with the scalar offset μ = ν_j. So `find_cut_single` / `solve_separation`
# (separation.jl) and `_gamma_over_full_from_cand` are reused verbatim;
# AD only swaps the master and runs the oracle n times (one per good).
#
# Depends on (in scope once setup.jl has included gurobi_env.jl and
# separation.jl): `_gurobi_env`, `find_cut_single`,
# `_gamma_over_full_from_cand`.

# shared drivers (run_one_method.jl / run_test.jl) read `fa.m`, deepcopy, and
# serialize it like any market object.
#
# NOTE: the drivers read the test error from `history[:test_err]` (computed

# (`validate_surrogate`) is not wired for AD (neither as surrogate nor as

    ad_market_from_atoms(cands, B) -> ArrowDebreuMarket

Convert the AD CG loop's internal state — the atom list `cands` (each a
NamedTuple with `class`/`params`) and the m×n endowment matrix `B` from the
final master solve — into an `ArrowDebreuMarket`.

Atom storage uses the CES (c, ρ) parameterization (same map as
`add_column_to_market!` in separation.jl):
- `:ces`    — c = exp(y / (1+σ)), ρ = σ/(1+σ), with y shifted so max(y) = 0.
- `:linear` — c = exp(y), ρ = 1 (compute_gamma/ces_share special-case σ = ∞).
- `:leontief` cannot ride the (c, ρ) form (σ → -1 diverges); run_ad_tracked
  rejects it up front.

The market's endowments are `b = Matrix(B')` (n×m, note transpose: B is m×n).

    solve_wealth_redist_primal_ad(Ξ, γ; masks=nothing, delta=1.0, verbose=false, timelimit=nothing)

Solve the Arrow–Debreu master (`eq.ad.master` / scaled `eq.ad.master.scaled`
in wealth-dist.tex), optionally with endowment masks (`eq.ad.mask`,
sec.wealth.ad.mask) and a supply scale δ (sec.wealth.ad.scale):

    L^AD = min_{b, s, [δ]}  Σ_{k,j} |s_{k,j}|
    s.t.  s_k + Σ_t ⟨p_k, b_t⟩ γ_{t,k} = P_k g_k + (δ-1) p_k,   ∀k∈[K]
          Σ_t b_t = δ·1   (componentwise, n rows)
          b_t ∈ ℝⁿ₊,  (b_t)_l = 0 ∀ l ∉ S_t,  s_k ∈ ℝⁿ,  [δ ≥ 0]

The predictor coefficient on `b[t,l]` in balance row (k,j) is
`γ[t,k,j]·p_k[l]` (since ⟨p_k,b_t⟩ = Σ_l p_k[l] b[t,l]); the program is an
LP in `b` (and δ — both the shifted balance and the scaled supply are
jointly linear in (b, δ)). The ‖·‖∞-per-sample → Σ|·| objective is lifted
via auxiliary `tt ≥ ±s`, matching the Fisher master.

Arguments:
- Ξ: Vector of (p_k, g_k) tuples, K observations.
- γ: bidding tensor of size (m, K, n) (atom t's share γ_t(p_k)).

Keyword arguments:
- `masks::Union{Vector{Vector{Int}},Nothing}` — per-atom endowment supports
  S_t ⊆ [n] (sec.wealth.ad.mask). Atom t gets variables only for goods in
  masks[t]; `nothing` ⇒ full support for every atom (the unmasked master).
  Every good must be owned by at least one atom, else the supply row is
  infeasible (asserted).
- `delta::Union{Real,Symbol}` — surrogate supply scale δ (eq.ad.master.scaled).
  A number fixes δ (default 1.0 recovers eq.ad.master exactly: the shift
  (δ-1)p_k vanishes and supply is unit). `:free` makes δ ≥ 0 a decision
  variable; the master stays an LP whose dual gains the scalar constraint
  Σ_k⟨u_k,p_k⟩ ≤ ⟨ν,1⟩ and whose objective becomes the excess-demand
  comparison Σ_k⟨u_k, P_k g_k - p_k⟩ (eq.ad.dual.scaled) — all handled
  automatically by LP duality; the pricing cuts are unchanged.
- `cache::Union{Ref,Nothing}` — persistent JuMP model (same protocol as the
  Fisher master's cache). On hit, only the new atoms' masked b variables are
  appended via `set_normalized_coefficient`; the K·n balance rows (the
  O(K·m·n·|S|) expression-construction cost of a rebuild), the slack/lift
  variables, the supply rows, the δ variable, and the objective are all
  reused. The caller wipes the Ref to force a rebuild (e.g. after
  `drop_zero_atoms_ad` reshuffles γ rows). The δ spec must not change across
  cached solves (asserted).
- `timelimit::Union{Real,Nothing}` — accepted for API compatibility but
  intentionally NOT applied to the master solve. Gurobi's barrier (Method=2,
  no crossover) returns no solution if cut off before convergence, which makes
  the downstream `value(...)` reads crash; the CG loop enforces the wall-clock
  budget between iterations instead, so the master always runs to completion.

Returns `(B, s, model, balance, supply, δ_val)`:
- B: m×n endowment matrix (zeros outside each atom's mask).
- s: K×n slack matrix.
- model, balance (K×n ConstraintRef), supply (length-n ConstraintRef vector).
- δ_val: the supply scale used (the fixed number, or the optimal value of
  the free variable).

Arrow–Debreu pricing (`eq.ad.pricing`). The most-violated cut is

    π^AD = max_{j∈[n]} [ sup_{γ∈ℋ_H} Σ_k ⟨(p_k)_j u_k, γ(p_k)⟩ − ν_j ],

i.e. for each good j run the homothetic separation oracle on the
price-reweighted dual ũ^{(j)}_k = (p_k)_j · u_k with scalar offset ν_j,
and keep the candidate with the largest reduced cost across goods. The
inner sup is exactly `find_cut_single` (separation.jl) with μ = ν_j.

Two accelerations over the naive n-call loop (CG correctness needs *a*
violated cut, not the most violated one):

1. Early exit (`early_exit_rc`): goods are scanned in random order and the
   scan stops at the first candidate with `rc > early_exit_rc`. Pass the CG
   loop's `tol_rc`; `nothing` disables and scans all n goods (exact max).
2. Threading: when Julia has >1 thread AND `:linear ∉ classes`, the n calls
   run under `Threads.@threads`. The linear MIP oracle keeps a module-level
   Gurobi-model cache (`_linear_model_cache`) that is not thread-safe, so any
   class list containing `:linear` falls back to the serial scan. (CES /
   Leontief oracles are pure Optim.jl + thread-local allocations except the
   CES dual-LP warm start, which builds a fresh Mosek model per call.)
   Threading and early exit compose: each thread checks a shared atomic flag.

A third reduction (pricing side, independent of the endowment masks): the
`scan_order` argument prioritizes the goods whose cuts are most likely
violated — e.g. sorted by the master's per-good residual. Combined with
early exit, only those "interesting" coordinates actually get an oracle
call; the master keeps full endowments B. The order always covers all n
goods, so a scan with no violated cut still certifies convergence.

Returns the winning candidate NamedTuple `(γ_new, params, obj, class, rc, good)`
(γ_new over the full Ξ; `good` is the index j whose reweighted oracle won —
also used to build the atom's endowment mask, cf. sec.wealth.ad.mask), or
`nothing` if every scanned good's oracle failed.

Arrow–Debreu analog of `drop_zero_columns!`: drop atoms whose endowment
collapsed to ~0 (the master set `b_t ≈ 0`, so the atom contributes nothing
to the predictor `Σ_t ⟨p,b_t⟩ γ_t(p)`). An atom is kept iff
`max_l |B[t,l]| > tol`. Prunes the `γ_ref` tensor in place; the caller
re-slices `cands` and `B` by the returned `keep` to stay aligned. With unit
supply, `Σ_t b_t = 1` guarantees `max_t B[t,l] ≥ 1/m > tol` for each good,
so `keep` is never empty. With a free supply scale, δ* ≈ 0 collapses every
endowment; in that case nothing is dropped (the atoms' preferences are
still needed if δ moves away from 0 in a later iteration).
